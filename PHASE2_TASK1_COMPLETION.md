- API errors (4xx, 5xx responses)
- Validation errors (user input)
- Storage errors (AsyncStorage failures)
- Unknown errors (fallback handling)
```

### Toast Notification Types
```typescript
- Success: Green with checkmark icon
- Error: Red with alert icon
- Warning: Orange with warning icon
- Info: Blue with info icon
- Loading: Blue with loading spinner (persistent)
```
