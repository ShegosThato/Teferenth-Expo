## 📝 Technical Details

### Video Generation Process
1. **Input Collection**: Gathers all scene images and text from the WatermelonDB database
2. **Command Construction**: Builds a complex FFmpeg command with filters for:
   - Image scaling and padding
   - Text overlay with customizable position and styling
   - Scene transitions with configurable effects
   - Video encoding with optimized settings
3. **Execution**: Runs the FFmpeg command asynchronously with progress tracking
4. **Output Handling**: Saves the generated video to the device's media library
5. **Database Update**: Updates the project in WatermelonDB with the video URL

### Video Player Features
- Modal presentation for focused viewing
- Native video controls for playback
- Thumbnail support for video preview
- Proper cleanup when closed

## 🔄 Next Steps

With the client-side video generation complete, the app now has a fully functional offline-first architecture. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Advanced Video Options** - More customization options for video generation
2. **Video Editing** - Allow users to edit generated videos
3. **Video Sharing** - Implement sharing options for generated videos
4. **Performance Optimization** - Further optimize video generation for better performance

## 🏁 Conclusion

The implementation of client-side video generation completes the offline-first architecture of the Tefereth Scripts app. This powerful feature transforms the app into a truly self-contained creative tool that can function entirely offline, providing users with a seamless experience from text to video without requiring an internet connection.

This implementation sets a new standard for mobile creative tools and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
